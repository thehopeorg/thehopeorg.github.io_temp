&lt;p&gt;The pattern of “the Tree of the Sefirot” (“The Holy Tree” in the Zohar and commonly called “The Tree of Life”) is no doubt the most famous topic of Kabbalah teachings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most books on the market that treat the Kabbalah deal only with this Tree, and the first knowledge of novices to the Kabbalah usually identifies it with the Tree of the Sefirot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following we shall bring the essential terms and their graphic expression. The pattern describes the flow of the Ḥayut – “vital intelligence” – that  maintains all the worlds – and therefore is considered as the picture of “The Tree of Life” (Ḥayim).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern of 32 elements. The number 32 is
marked in Hebrew by the two letters Lamed (Gematria value 30)
and Beyt (Gematria value 2), which together spell LeV (לב – (namely
“Heart”. So this is a picture of the “Heart” that maintains all the worlds.
This is an abstract pattern, essentially graphic, of what is called in
mathematics “graph” – points or vertices that are connected by some lines or
conduits.[1] According to the instructions given in the Sefer Yeẓirah, where
the term “Sefirot” was first mentioned, what are entailed are ten vertices
(called “Sefirot”) that are interlinked by 22 lines of conduits – Ẓinorot.[2]
These 22 lines are identified in Sefer Yezirah with the 22 Hebrew (Ịvriot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
