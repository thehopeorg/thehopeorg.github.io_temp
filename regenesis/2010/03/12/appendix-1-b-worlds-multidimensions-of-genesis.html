<p>Genesis as multidimensional text; Sefer Yetzirah and Parashat Bereshit; The Name of YHWH as a Multidimensional Ladder</p>

<h3 id="worlds-and-dimensions-of-genesis">Worlds and Dimensions of Genesis</h3>

<p>In the introduction and in the exegesis of the <em>Bereshit</em> portion, we have brought the concepts of “worlds” in the Kabbalah. Here we shall try to understand the matter of these invisible spiritual worlds through the geometrical concept of “dimensions” that are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other. It is very fashionable these days to discuss invisible higher worlds in terms of multidimensional space or hyperspace, which seems like the new thing. But in the sequel, we shall see that this approach has already been adopted in the earliest book of the Kabbalah – the “Sefer Yetzirah” (Book of Formation”) – which can be regarded as a Kabbalah interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis, and that such a multidimensional approach is employed also in the Kabbalah and <em>Ḥassidut</em>. If so, there is also no reason to deny the possibility that this was also the pattern that was employed by the editors of the Book of Genesis.</p>

<p>The aim of this essay is to reveal a true Torah code that is based on the five-dimensional geometry of Sefer Yetzirah as already employed in the Book of Genesis. As mentioned, Light - which appears in Genesis as the first created thing – according to current scientific view is vibrations in five-dimensional space. In general, we can discern in the scriptures two methods that mark what we nowadays characterize as “dimensions”. One method is to employ powers – the number of times a number is multiplied by itself. Thus, we shall see in the following that the name of the chosen one – Abram has Gematria value of 243, which is 3 to the fifth power (3x3x3x3x3 = 243) and thus also represents the 5-dimensional hypercube of Sefer Yetzirah (attributed by tradition to Abraham).</p>

<p>Another method, that issues from the first is to count the powers of ten in a specific number – the units represent the first dimension (e.g. length), the tens represent the second dimension (e.g. breadth), the hundreds represent a third dimension (e.g. height) and from here it is possible to continue, where thousands already represent 4-Dimensional hyperspace, and myriads represent fifth dimension (this method is explicitly employed in many Kabbalah texts).</p>

<p>In the 60's of the 20th century Herbert Marcuse's book “One-Dimensional Man” served as a manifest for the rebel students. Marcuse used this geometrical metaphor to criticize modern consumer society that suffers from narrow consciousness and leads to life devoid of psychological and spiritual “depth”. The dimensional metaphor of consciousness was advanced by the book of Abbott Abbott “Flatland”, which describes a two-dimensional world whose residents persecute whoever raises the possibility of the existence of a three-dimensional world, and through the work of Charles Hinton, that aimed to nurture expanded consciousness that can perceive four-dimensional space.</p>

<p>The expectation and call for multidimensional awareness promise solutions to some of the contemporary world ills. The scientific revolution (“The Tree of Knowledge”) progressed in the route charted by Descartes – disjunction between the soul and the material world. It was Descartes who fixed the modern conception of using three-dimensional coordinates for the description and measurement of all the phenomena of the physical world. But in the process modern science lost just what was the really important for Descartes – namely the soul.</p>

<p><strong>Sefer Yetzirah and Parashat Bereshit</strong></p>

<p>Tradition ascribes Sefer Yetzirah to the patriarch Abraham. Among modern scholars there are divergences about the time of its composition, though most agree about the range posited by Gershom Scholem: between the 2nd and 6th century C.E. (parallel to the time of the pre-Kabbalah “<em>Heikhalot</em> literature”). Yehudah Libes, in his book “Ars Poetica in Sefer Yetsira” attributes it to the circle of the 2nd Temple in the 1st century C.E., and there are some that attribute it to the period after the appearance of Islam in the 7th century. I tend to combine the two approaches and regard the first, terse and poetical part the derivative of an esoteric inner text of the Temple scribes, whereas its expanded part, which contains the exhaustive lists  of 3, of 7 and of 12 elements, I regard as an addendum by a sixth century Jewish astrological-healer. What is pertinent for us here is the profound conception of Sefer Yetzirah of the processes of creation and formation as an esoteric explanation of the Bereshit narrative.</p>

<p>In parallel with the text that opens the Book of Genesis – “In the beginning (<em>Bereshit</em>) God (<em>Elohim</em>) created heaven and earth” – Sefer Yetzirah starts with these words: “In thirty-two wondrous paths of wisdom – YAH, the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, the Living God and King of the Universe, El SHADAI, merciful and compassionate, Dweller up above, whose habitation is eternity, His Name holy - engraved and created his universe in through three <em>Sefarim</em>: (1) Sefer (book) = writing (letters); (2) Sefor (counting) = number; (3) Sippur (telling) = speech (sounds). Ten Sefirot (numbers) made of Nothingness, Twenty-two foundation Letters”. Thus, “<em>Bereshit</em>” is parallel to some extent to “thirty-two wondrous paths of wisdom” (much like “Elohim” parallels the above ten divine appellations in Sefer Yetzirah and the three Sefarim parallel the plenitude of “heaven and earth”).</p>

<p>These ten Sefirot are described in several ways, including: “Ten Sefirot made of Nothing (or alternatively, “of control” - <em>Blimah</em>). Their number is Ten that have no end: The range of beginning, the range of end; The range of good, the range of evil; The range of height, the range of depth; The range of east, The range of west; The range of north, the range of south. Only Lord, God Faithful King, ruler of them all from the Residence of His Holiness to Eternity”. And likewise: “Ten Sefirot made of Nothing (or “of control”). The first: The spirit (wind) of the Living God. The second: Wind from the Spirit (wind). The third: Water from the Wind. The fourth: Fire from the Water; and Height and Depth, and East and West, and North and South” – like the five axes of expansion in the five-dimensional (5D) space.</p>

<p>In another place, the book regards the Sefirot in terms of <strong>Ọlam</strong> , <strong>Shanah</strong> , <strong>Nefesh</strong> – “World, Year, Soul”. <em>Ọlam</em>-World is the perceivable three-dimensional worlds, and it parallels the six directions enumerated above. “ <strong>Shanah</strong> -Year” is a dimension of time that extends between “The range of beginning and the range of end”, whereas <strong>Nefesh</strong> -Soul is an ethical dimension that sets measures between “The range of good and the range of evil”.</p>

<p>From the description the created world in Sefer Yetzirah as a hypercube of five dimensions, there emerges the primal state of the thirty-two paths (or the direction-lines), because the 4-dimensional hypercube has 32 edges, and the 5-dimensional “hyper-hypercube” has 32 vertices. This number then is not just the happenstance of the sum of the 10 digits and the 22 Hebrew letters, but is of essence and sign by itself. In fact, as we saw in the first verse of Genesis, 22 letters are the <strong>Miluy</strong> (filling) and intermediary between two wholes (the perfect numbers of 6 and 28). In the sequel of the first chapter of Genesis appear the 10 Divine utterances as well as the 32 appearances of the name “Elohim”. In Sefer Yetzirah, the 22 letters intermediate between the two primal numerical principles of the 10 Sephirot (as the axes of five-dimensional space) and the 32 paths, which are the 32 directions in five-dimensional space: 32 – 10 = 22.</p>

<p>Later the Kabbalah developed (or revealed) the pattern of “the Tree of the Sefirot”, or “The Tree of Life” (see appendix 1-A). This is a kind of two-dimensional schematic map of that same five-dimensional universe. The six lower “Sefirot of Construction”(from <strong>Ḥesed</strong> to <strong>Yesod</strong> ) are also the six directions of three-dimensional space, corresponding to “Ọlam haYetzirah”. The three supernal Sefirot are each orthogonal to its former (from “below”) and in a higher dimension. The Sefirah of <strong>Binah</strong> corresponds to <strong>Ọlam</strong>** haBeri'a <strong><em>h</em>, the Sefirah of</strong> Ḥokhmah<strong>(Wisdom) corresponds to</strong>Ọlam <strong>**ha'Atẓilut</strong> and the Sefirah of <strong>Keter</strong> is beyond these dimensions and surrounds them.</p>

<p>Consequently, Olam haYetzirah (in which, according to the Kabbalah, the spirits {same in Hebrew as “winds”} operate) is like a 3-D world of the motion that is recorded within the four-dimensional space-time: “round and round goes the wind/spirit, and on its circuits the wind/spirit returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:6), whereas Ọlam haBeri'ah (in which operate the oversouls – <strong>Neshamot</strong> is a kind of super-temporal five-dimensional world, as describes in Sefer Yetzirah.</p>

<p>The five-level scale of the soul ( <strong>Nefesh</strong> , <strong>Ru'aḥ</strong> , <strong>Neshamah</strong> , <strong>Ḥayah</strong> &amp; <strong>Yeḥidah</strong> ) of the Kabbalah is the fifth-dimension axis of Sefer Yetzirah, a dimension that is orthogonal to the four dimensions of space-time and penetrates it.</p>

<p><strong>The Name of YHWH as a Multidimensional Ladder</strong></p>

<p>According to the Book of Proverbs (18:10) “The Name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runs into it, and is exalted”. This means that the very name <strong>YHWH</strong> (the Tetragrammaton, the four-lettered Shem YHWH) is a kind of a tower or a ladder that stands between heaven and earth and lifts whoever contemplates it up to spiritual situation of the righteous and exalted, one who sojourns in the higher worlds. Indeed, the Name ( <strong>haShem</strong> ) of YHWH serves in the Kabbalah as a map of the worlds – where the lower H ( <strong>He</strong>   <strong>ה</strong> ) is the bottom edge and the top tip point of the first letter Y ( <strong>Yod</strong>   <strong>י</strong> ) is the point of contact with the highest world. According to this fairly common practice, the lower H ( <strong>ה</strong> ) represents the Sefirah of <strong>Malkhut</strong> (Kingship) and the World of Action <strong>(Ọlam haẠsiah</strong>), the Wav ( <strong>ו</strong>** -<strong>with numerical value of six) represents the six Sefirot (“the Six Edges”) of the World of Formation (Ọlam haYetzirah), the upper H (</strong>ה<strong>) represents the Sefirah of</strong>Binah<strong>(Understanding) and the world of</strong>Beri'ah<strong>(Formation, and also “The Maternal Face” of the Godhead), the Y (</strong>Yod ** ** י<strong>) represents the Sefirah of</strong>Ḥokhmah<strong>(Wisdom, and also “The Paternal Face” of the Godhead), whereas the top tip of the Y (</strong>Yod ** ** י<strong>) represents the point of contact with the Sefirah of</strong>Keter<strong>(Crown, which like its name implies, surrounds –</strong>Koteret<strong>– all the worlds) and with the world of</strong>Adam Qadmon** (the Primordial Image).</p>

<p>Yet the three Hebrew letters that comprise the Tetragrammaton can be conceived as representing the geometrical concepts of Point ( <strong>י</strong> ), Line ( <strong>ו</strong> ) and surface ( <strong>ה</strong> ). If so, it is possible to regard the “tower” of the Name ( <strong>Shem</strong> ) of <strong>YHWH</strong> as constituting the geometrical representations of the letters, which combine together into the following geometrical structure:</p>

<p>The lower H ( <strong>ה</strong> ) is the surface upon earth, upon which the tower of haShem is situated. The W ( <strong>ו</strong> ) is conceived as the line that is perpendicular to that base surface. The upper H ( <strong>ה</strong> ) would be regarded as a surface – namely two dimensions – that is perpendicular to the three-dimensional cubic space, and with these, there forms a five-dimensional space, as is presented also in Sefer Yetzirah. The Y ( <strong>י</strong> ) is, as noted, a point of contact for additional dimension(s), especially by means of its top tip, that represents the trend towards innumerable dimensions, or a point of contact with still higher worlds. While this geometrical understanding is based on the form of the Hebrew letters in the square (<em>Ashuri</em>) script, it is also valid to the round cursive form of the Hebrew letters. The letter H of these round letters represents a circle (or a ring between concentric circles). In this way, the tower would be in a form of a cylinder, whose top is surrounded by a Dome that represents the two higher hyper-dimensions. Intriguingly – this geometric scheme of “The Name of the Lord” is realized in the very ceiling of the Dome of the Rock on Jerusalem Temple Mount - 32 figures with 32 “paths of Wisdom” between them.</p>
