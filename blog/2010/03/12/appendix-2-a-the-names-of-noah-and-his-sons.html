The name " <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" ( <strong>נח</strong> ) and  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  ( <strong>ח"ן</strong> ) - "the Hidden Knowledge"
<strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  and Consolation (Neḥamah)
<strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  -  <strong>Guidance</strong>  ( <strong>H</strong> a <strong>nḥ</strong> a <strong>y</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ),  <strong>Camping</strong>  ( <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>n</strong> a <strong>y</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) and  <strong>Rest</strong>  ( <strong>M</strong> e <strong>nuḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> )
<strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  -  <strong>Laying</strong>  ( <strong>h</strong> a <strong>n</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) and  <strong>Landing</strong>  ( <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥit</strong> a <strong>h</strong> )
<strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  and  <strong>Sacrificial Offering ** ( **M</strong> i <strong>nḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> )
From  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  to  <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> e <strong>mi</strong> a <strong>h</strong>
<strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong> ,  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  and  <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>nin</strong> a <strong>h</strong>
The  <strong>Name</strong>  of  <strong>No</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong>  ( <strong>נוח</strong>  - with full spelling) and the number 64
The  <strong>Name</strong>  " <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>"
The  <strong>Academies of S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>  and  <strong>Ẹ</strong> ve <strong>r</strong></p>

<p><strong>The name **" **N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" ( <strong>נח</strong> ) and  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  The sentence "and  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>   ( <strong>ח"ן</strong> ) - " <strong>the Hidden Knowledge</strong>"</p>

<p>We have seen that in the name " <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" ( <strong>נח</strong> ) there is a hint about  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  ( <strong>ח"ן</strong> ) - "the Hidden Knowledge" (<em>Ḥokhmat haNistar</em>) and, indeed, there are many secrets hidden within the name " <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" and its Gematria value.</p>

<p>In many Hassidic texts,  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  is the occult wisdom. For example, in the first teaching of Rabbi Nachman of Breslow's collection (<em>Liqute Moharan</em>) is that the  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  ( <strong>ח"ן</strong> ) is the capacity to bring the prayer to be accepted. The letter  <strong>Ḥ</strong> et ( <strong>ח</strong> ) signifies vitality ( <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>yut</strong> ) and Wisdom ( <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>o</em> <strong>k</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong> ), the Sun and the Intellect, whereas the letter  <strong>N</strong> un ( <strong>נ</strong> ון) signifies the Sephirah of Malkhut (the Feminine) and the Moon. The secret lies in joining them together through prayer and the study of the inner domain of the Torah.</p>

<p>Both  <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>  and  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  have the Gematria value of 58. The number 58 is the sum of the two numbers that we have explored in the first portion, Parashat Bereshit: 32 "wonderous paths of wisdom" (of 4D) and 26 (Gematria of the Name YHWH), which are the number of directions in the (3D) World of Formation – 32 + 26 = 58. The summation 32 + 26 recalls the two words  <strong>Kvod YHWH</strong> , which is the Divine Glory through which the hidden deity appears in this world, whether through the clouds of glory at the exodus and the Tabernacle, or at the Jerusalem Temple or in the cloud of Ezekiel's vision. The first appearance of the divine glory, however, is in the rainbow of the Covenant with Noah.</p>

<p>The number 58 has deep connection to the system of "Names of  <strong>H</strong> a <strong>W</strong> a <strong>Y</strong> a <strong>H</strong>" that are derived by "filling" with the letters of the names of the four letters of the Name of YHWH. Several alternative fillings are possible, due to the different spellings of the letters  <strong>H</strong>'e ( <strong>ה</strong> ) and  <strong>W</strong>'aw <strong>(ו</strong>) – namely הא, הה, הו and ואו, וו, ויו. The Lurianic Kabbalah employed four such names – Shem ẠB with Gematria value of 72,  <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>   <strong>S</strong> a <strong>G</strong>  with value of 63,  <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>   <strong>M</strong> a <strong>H</strong>  with value of 45 and  <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>   <strong>B</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  whose numerical value is 52. Now (72 + 63 + 45 + 52) / 4 = 58, which is the median value of the four Names of  <strong>H</strong> a <strong>W</strong> a <strong>Y</strong> a <strong>H</strong>.</p>

<p>Now  <strong>58</strong>    <strong>הי ואו הה יוד</strong>  (reading from right to left). So 58 is the value of another Name of  <strong>H</strong> a <strong>W</strong> a <strong>Y</strong> a <strong>H</strong> , one that is arranged according to the order of the four Names –  <strong>יוד</strong>  (fitting  <strong>S</strong> <em>he</em> <strong>m ẠB</strong> , written in the same unchanging manner for all the four Holy Names), ** <strong>** הי</strong> (fitting <strong>S **<em>he</em></strong> m S <strong><em>a</em></strong> G <strong>, written with the letter</strong> Y'<strong><em>ud</em> which is used in both Shem ẠB and Shem SaG),  ואו (fitting with **S **<em>he</em></strong> m M <strong><em>a</em></strong> H<strong>, written with the letter Aleph (</strong>א<strong>) of **S **<em>he</em></strong> m H <strong><em>a</em></strong> W <strong><em>a</em></strong> Y <strong><em>a</em></strong> H** with the filling of Alephs, where the word "Aleph" means training and instruction), and <strong>הה</strong> (fitting with <strong>S **<em>he</em></strong> m B <strong><em>e</em></strong> N** and written in the form of the automatic reverberation of letters, which is characteristic of this Name). So this hidden Holy Name contains and connects the qualities of the other Holy Names.</p>

<p>The number 58 is also connected with the first divine creation utterance: the Gematria value of " <strong>Y</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>h</strong> <em>i</em> ** Or<strong>" ( **יהי אור</strong>  - let there be light) is 232, that is, 58 times four (and we have already shown that 4 is connected with building).</p>

<p>The name " <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" itself is a word (or  <strong>T</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>v</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong>  – "box") of two letters. The original Hebrew word roots are of two letters (as in the grammar of the Sefer Yeẓirah). The roots that are employed nowadays are of three letters, and the two-letter combination "Noaḥ" comprises a part of several Hebrew word roots with their various manifestations.</p>

<p>(note: in the following examples, the Biblical quotations are given in purple and the letters of the name of <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong> are marked in red, e.g. ) <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong> ; the Hebrew root letters in a transliterated Hebrew word and name are marked as <strong>bold,</strong></p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  and  <strong>Consolation</strong>  ( <strong>N</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>ḥ</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong> )</p>

<p>"And he (Lemekh) called his name Noaḥ, saying, This one shall comfort us ( <strong>ye</strong>** n <strong><em>a</em></strong> ḥ <strong><em>a</em></strong> m <strong><em>e</em></strong> nu<strong>) for our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground (<em>Adamah</em> – living earth) which the Lord has cursed" (Gen. 5:29). On the other hand: "And the Lord (YHWH) repented (</strong>v <strong>a</strong> y <strong>i</strong> n <strong>a</strong> ḥ <strong>e</strong> m<strong>) that he had made man on earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man (Adam) whom I have created from the face of the earth (Adamah): both man (Adam) and beast (Behemah), and creeping things, and the birds of the air; for I repent (</strong>n <strong>i</strong> ḥ <strong>a</strong> mti<strong>)  that I have made them. But **N **oa</strong> ḥ** found favour (<strong>Ḥ **e</strong> n**) in the eyes of the Lord" (6:6-8).</p>

<p>In both passages there is an association of the name " <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>" with " <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>m</strong> a <strong>h</strong>", but in two different senses, positive and negative. There is a  <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>m</strong> a <strong>h</strong>  of restoration, and there is  <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>m</strong> a <strong>h</strong>  of regret and desire to annul that which has been made. Perhaps because of the good hope that his father expected from him, that his son would become the comforter of humankind, that Noaḥ became "a just man and perfect", and when "all flesh had corrupted its way" still "Noaḥ found favour ( <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>n</strong> ) in the eyes of the Lord".</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  -  <strong>Guidance</strong>  ( <strong>H</strong> a <strong>nḥ</strong> a <strong>y</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ),  <strong>Camping</strong>  ( <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>n</strong> a <strong>y</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ),  <strong>Res</strong> t ( <strong>M</strong> e <strong>n</strong>** u <strong>**ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> )</p>

<p>The Parashah of  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  tells about the dove that was sent after the raven, and at first "the dove found no rest (Menuḥah) for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark" (8:9).</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, when Par'ọh had let the people go, that God led them ( <strong>n</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>ḥ</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>m</strong> ) not through the way of the land of the <em>Pelishtim,</em> although that was near; for God said, Lest the people regret ( <strong>y</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>n</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>ḥ</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>m</strong> ) when they see war, and they return to Miẓrayim"(Exodus 13:17). The motif of guidance repeats at the same chapter (verse 21): "And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them ( <strong>l</strong> a <strong>nḥ</strong>** ot <strong>a</strong> m<strong>) the way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might go by day and night". The order of the journeys was "they departe/removed from X…. and they pitched (</strong>v <strong><em>a</em></strong> y <strong><em>a</em></strong> ḥ <strong><em>a</em></strong> n<strong><em>u</em>) at Y": guidance - **h **<em>a</em></strong> nḥ <strong><em>a</em></strong> y <strong><em>a</em></strong> h** - (through the lillar of smoke and of fire) and then camping - <strong>Ḥ **a</strong> n <strong>a</strong> y <strong>a</strong> h<strong>. (And we learn that the inspiration of the Torah to Moshe occurred only when the children of Israel campted (</strong>ḥ <strong>a</strong> n <strong>**u</strong> ) and found rest ( <strong>M</strong> e <strong>n</strong>** u <strong>**ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ). Only then the Levites erected the Tabernacle and Moshe could enter to the innermost chamber to the dwelling (Shekhinah) of God and then hear "the voice speaking to him from off the covering that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two keruvim: and it spke to him" (Numbers 7:89).</p>

<p>\&lt;\&gt;</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>**  - Laying<strong>(</strong>h <strong><em>a</em></strong> n <strong><em>a</em></strong> ḥ <strong><em>a</em></strong> h<strong>) and</strong> Landing<strong>(</strong>n <strong><em>e</em></strong> ḥ <strong>**it</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong> )</p>

<p>It is written about Adam "And the Lord God (YHWH Elohim) took the man (adam), and put him (vayaniḥehu) into the garden of Ẹden" (Gen. 2:15) - he was put by God inside the perfect environment that has been previously been prepared for him, though for the need "to till it and to keep it". Noa <strong>ḥ</strong>  too was put, as if laid, into the special environment – but this time it was an artificial ecological environment. an "Ecosystem", that had been built by Noah and his sons.</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  was also the first man to land ( <strong>n</strong>** a <strong>**ḥ</strong>** a <strong>**t</strong> ) from his vessel to the renewed ("terraformed") earth. Landing is a sort of descent and fall, and we shall see the landing down of  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>h</strong>  in the drunkenness and the inferiority ( <strong>n</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> i <strong>tut</strong> ) of  <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>m</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>**   <strong>and</strong>  Sacrificial Offering<strong>(</strong>M <strong><em>i</em></strong> nḥ <strong><em>a</em></strong> h**)</p>

<p>Upon exiting the Ark,  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  made another building operation: "and  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  built an altar to the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar" (8:20).  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  appears here as a priest who brings sacrifices, and one (in contradistinction to Qayin) whose sacrifice was accepted. From here on the issue of sacrifices and offerings will reappear hundreds of times in the Torah.</p>

<p><strong>From **</strong> N <strong>oa</strong> ḥ <strong>** to **</strong> N <strong>e</strong> ḥ <strong>e</strong> mi <strong>a</strong> h**</p>

<p>The whole passage of the Torah and the Prophets goes between these two builders - from the building of the Ark by  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  and his sons to the collective building of the walls of Jerusalem under the direction of  <strong>N</strong> e <strong>ḥ</strong> e <strong>mi</strong> a <strong>h</strong>. Inside the box of the walls of Jerusalem the Temple was rebuilt as the place of safeguarding and editing of the Torah through  <strong>Ẹzra</strong>  the scribe and his entourage.</p>

<p>In between we find  <strong>M</strong> a <strong>n</strong>** o <strong>a</strong> ḥ <strong>, the father of Samson, who is the prototype of the victorious Messiah. As for the name of the last Messiah, there are many conjectures, but the most common is that his name would be ** M **e</strong> n <strong>a</strong> ḥ <strong>e</strong> m** (comforter).</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong> ,  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  and  <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>n</strong>** in <strong>a</strong> h**</p>

<p>After God repented ( <strong>h</strong> i <strong>t</strong>** n <strong>a</strong> ḥ <strong>e</strong> m<strong>) that He has created humankind and decided to destroy them, he had mercy (</strong>ḥ <strong>a</strong> n <strong>a</strong> n<strong>) toward Noaḥ - the one who "found grace (</strong>Ḥ <strong><em>e</em></strong> n<strong>) in the eyes of the Lord" (Gen. 6:8). The virtue of Noah brought out the divine qualities of being merciful (</strong>ḥ <strong>a</strong> n <strong>**un</strong> ) and compassionate ( <strong>r</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>ḥ</strong>** um**).</p>

<p>The sentence "and  <strong>N</strong> <em>oa</em> <strong>ḥ</strong>  found  <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>n</strong>" is an obvious and intended word play. " <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>" is " <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>n</strong>" spelled backward. The word " <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>n</strong>" is commonly explained as the acronym of " <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>o</em> <strong>k</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong> _ _ <strong>N</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>st</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>r</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>t</strong>" (Hidden Wisdom) or <strong>ח</strong> <em>"</em> <strong>ן</strong> (and there are also those explaining it as " <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>o</em> <strong>k</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>t</strong> _ _ <strong>N</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>s</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>im</strong>" (Feminine Wisdom).</p>

<p>As noted in the chapter, the Gematria value of  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>  (who is "husbandman of the Adamah", the living Earth; Gen. 9:20) is 58, which is also the Gematria value of " <strong>h</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>G</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>n</strong>" – the known garden, the Garden of  <strong>Ẹd</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>n</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Name Noaḥ ** ( **נוח ** - with full spelling) and  **the number 64</strong></p>

<p>Nowadays, the name is generally spelled in its full form as  <strong>No</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong>  -  <strong>נוח</strong>. This name (in its full spelling, with the addition of the letter W'aw (ו), which is one of the letters of the Name of YHWH) has the Gematria value of 64 (the full number of situations in the Chinese I-Ching or "Book of Changes"; whereas in the Qabbalah by Gematria S'D ( <strong>ס</strong>" <strong>ד</strong> ) – the common acronym of " <strong>Siạt</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h d</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>S</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>y</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong>" (Divine Help). This Gematria value is equal to that of " <strong>Ad</strong> a <strong>m</strong>  ve <strong>Ḥ</strong> a <strong>v</strong> a <strong>h</strong>" (Adam and Eve) – with Noah there is a new beginning to humankind.</p>

<p>We find the word spelled this way only once in the Torah: "And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that emenated upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders; and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them ( <strong>k</strong> <em>'</em> <strong>n</strong>** o <strong><em>a</em></strong> ḥ** <em>ạleyhem haruaḥ),</em> they prophesied, but continued not" (Numbers 11:25).</p>

<p>The spirit that emanated upon Moshe also alighted ( <strong>n</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) upon the seventy elders of Israel. Likewise, "And when the sons of the prophets who were in  <strong>Y</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>riḥo</strong>  (Jericho) saw him, they said, The spirit of Eliyahu (Elijah) rests ( <strong>n</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) on Elisha; And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the grouond before him" (II Kings 2:15). And similarly: "And there shall come forth a rod of the stem of Yishay, and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest ( <strong>n</strong> a <strong>ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord" (Isaiah 11:1). There is a passage of the spirit of prophecy through a stage of " <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>", of rest ( <strong>M</strong> e <strong>n</strong>** u <strong>**ḥ</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ) and passivity.1</p>

<p>The name, or the principle, of " <strong>No</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong>" ( <strong>נוח</strong> ) is as result from the entry of the penetration of the W'aw of the holy spirit into the passive state of  <strong>N</strong> oa <strong>ḥ</strong>.</p>

<p>The number 64 is a significant number in its own right: 64 = 2^6 = 4^3 = 8^2, namely the number of square cells in a flat square of 8, like a chess board; the number of cubical cells in a box of 4x4x4 (and also the number of 6D cells of a 6D hypercube of 2x2x2x2x2x2). 64 is the number of world-year-soul states which are at the basis of the Taoist world-view and the I-Ching book, where they are represented by the 64 hexagrams. These 64 states are generally presented on the plane, in the form of 8x8, but these 64 states can also be arrayed in a cube of 4x4x4.</p>

<p>The number 64 has connection to the fourth "perfect Number (apparently the largest perfect number known in antiquity), which is 8128: 127 x 64 = 8,128. So, this perfect number is the product of the spatial principle of 64 and of another principle expressed by the number 127. We shall meet this number later, in the Parasha of  <strong>Ḥ</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>ye</strong> _ _ <strong>S</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>r</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong> , where we shall be able to appreciate the appearance of the fourth perfect number related to the cave of  <strong>M</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>k</strong> <em>h</em> <strong>pel</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong>  (multiplication) in <strong>Qiryat Arbạ</strong> (City of the Four).</p>

<p>The  <strong>Name</strong>  " <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>"</p>

<p><strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong>  is the "second round" of Adam. In the first deed of Adam, he composed names (Shemot) to all the animals, whereas the first creation of  <strong>N</strong> o'a <strong>ḥ</strong> , his firstborn, he called " <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>", namely "Name".</p>

<p>The name " <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>" is a root to the letters of  <strong>N</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>s</strong> <em>ha</em> <strong>m</strong> <em>a</em> <strong>h</strong>  ( <strong>נשמה</strong> ) – the Eternal or Over Soul. It is there between the letters  <strong>N</strong> un ( <strong>נ</strong>  or ** ן** ) - that signifies the Sephirah of  <strong>Bin</strong> a <strong>h</strong> ("the 50 {' <strong>נ</strong> } Gates of  <strong>Bin</strong> a <strong>h</strong>" {Understanding}; and the lower  <strong>H</strong>'e { <strong>ה</strong> } of the name of  <strong>YHWH</strong> , representing the Shekhinah and the World of Action. The connection between  <strong>Bin</strong> a <strong>h</strong>" {Understanding} and Action is through The Name -  <strong>H</strong> a <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong> ), which means that to comprehend and understand the components and procedures of action, one needs to give them names that explain them and that combine to a full explanation, (the Higher Knowledge - <strong>D</strong> <em>a'</em> <strong>ạt Ẹlyon</strong> ).2</p>

<p>The highest value of contemporary Judaism is " <strong>H</strong> a <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>" ( <strong>השם</strong> ), which is the reverse order of the letters of the name " <strong>M</strong> o <strong>s</strong> he <strong>h</strong>" (Moses –  <strong>משה</strong> ). In the Torah of Moshe, the divine name is of  <strong>YHWH</strong>. Present day Jews do not dare to pronounce the explicit Name and call it " <strong>H</strong> a <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>" (meaning literally "The Name").  It is said (in Naḥmanides' (<em>Ramban</em>) Torah commentary and in the Book of Zohar) that the whole entire Torah is the expanded Great Name of the Holy One. Therefore, also whoever reads aloud the Torah (<em>qore baTorah</em>) in truth, for its own sake (<em>Torah lishmah</em>) – (s)he is calling the divinity in her full name (<em>Shem haMeforash</em>) and may receive the answer of the Holy One.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the significance coded in the sum of the Gematria values of Noah and his sons: No'aḥ  58 + Shem  340 + Ḥam  48 + Yefet  490 = 936. The number 936, in turn 936 = 26 x 36. As we've already seen, 26 signifies the Name of  <strong>YHWH</strong> , whereas 36 signifies the array of " <strong>El</strong> eh" ( <strong>אלה</strong> ) – the manifest parts of God ( <strong>El</strong> o <strong>him</strong> ).</p>

<p><strong>The Academies of Shem and Ẹver</strong></p>

<p>The midrashim3tell of Noah's descendants  <strong>S</strong> <em>he</em> <strong>m</strong>  and  <strong>Ẹv</strong> <em>e</em> <strong>r</strong>  as if they held an academy (<em>Beit Midrash</em>) where they taught the  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  – the hidden wisdom of the Sons of Noah, especially the secrets of the Hebrew names –  <strong>S</strong> <em>he</em> <strong>mot</strong> _ _ <strong>Ịvr</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>yim</strong>  – and the Hebrew letters –  <strong>Ot</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>yot</strong> _ _ <strong>Ịvr</strong> <em>io</em> <strong>yot</strong>. This amounts to a  <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>** i<strong>-Semantic study place (<em>Beit Midrash</em>) that uses a universal language, assembled from all the world's languages and finds parallels among the diverse names, which is also a Hebrew exegesis – **M **<em>i</em></strong> dr <strong><em>a</em></strong> s <strong><em>h _** Ịv ****r**** i ** - that is based on Hebrew Language - ** Ịvr **_i</em></strong> t**_ _– as a universal esoteric language and searches to find the secrets that issue from the Hebrew letters, words and names. This operation may lead to the realization of the prophecy of Ẓephanyah "For then I will convert the people to a purer language". This will be the rectification to the confusion of languages of Babel.</p>

<p>By Gematria, " <strong>S</strong> he <strong>m</strong>" + " <strong>Ẹv</strong> e <strong>r</strong>"  340 + 272 = 612 (as the 613 commands minus one), which is also the Gematria value of  <strong>Brit</strong>  – covenant. To the extent that the Noahide dispensation may get accepted in the world, the pupils of the future academy of Shem and Ẹver would likely be allies to Israel.</p>

<p>This entire appendix may conceivably be regarded as a sample lesson of a modern incarnation of the Academy of Shem and Ẹver.</p>

<p>We have started this article noting Rabbi <strong>N</strong> a <strong>ḥm</strong> a <strong>n</strong> (Nachman) of Breslow's claim that the letters of  <strong>Ḥ</strong> e <strong>N</strong>  ( <strong>ח"ן</strong> ) have the capacity to bring the prayer to be accepted. We may end by pointing to the phenomenon of his adherents writing the name "Noaḥ" as graffiti on walls all over Israel as a sign of the Times:</p>

<p>Notes:
[1] Already the Sages observed the special character of the letters  <strong>H</strong>'e and  <strong>N</strong>'un, in that they are "letters that have no coupling (Zivug)" (whereas Aleph + Tet = Bet + Ḥet = Gimmel + Zayin = 10, and likewise with the letters Y'ud till Ẓadi). Therefore, their coupling is with "the aid of the Name (<em>be'ẹzrat haShem</em>)", which connects them to form " <strong>N</strong> e <strong>s</strong> ha <strong>m</strong> a <strong>h</strong>" ( <strong>נשמה</strong> )" - oversoul.</p>

The Hebrew word for both "spirit" and "wind" (and also direction) is  <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong>. The  <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong>  moves within the 3-dimensional space, which is symbolized by the Hebrew letter  <strong>W</strong>'aw ( <strong>ו</strong> ), whose numerical value is 6 and is used to signify the six main directions of the 3D space. Thus, there is "a storm wind ( <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong> ) coming out of the north" (Ezekiel 1:4), and also "Come from the four winds ( <strong>Ru</strong>' <strong>ḥot</strong> ), O spirit ( <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong> ) and breathe upon those slain, that they may live" (Ez. 37:9). But we also learn from Elijah "And He said, Go out, and stand upon the mountain before the Lord (YHWH) And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind ( <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong> ) rent the mountain and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wond ( <strong>Ru</strong>'a <strong>ḥ</strong> ); and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice"(1 Kings 19:11) – only when the whole noise {which derives from the mental state of the prophesier} rests, then the spirit lands to rest.</p>
